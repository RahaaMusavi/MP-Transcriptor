Middle Persian Transcriptor: It is a program coded in Python. 
It gets transliteration of Middle Persian words and returns an assumption of its transcription. Middle Persian has a very complicated script with several ideograms. 
Moreover, in Middle Persian script several phonemes are represented with one grapheme. 
This program basically trains a neuronal network based on the Pytorch tutorial for the seq2seq model for machine translation.
At the moment it is training on sentence level, but with one collaboration, I have upgraded it to train on word level and the results are more promising there.
This project is carried out as an MA end-of-the-semester programming task and at the moment for use inside the MPCD project.
